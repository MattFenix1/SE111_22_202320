                <p>Puss in Boots is a legendary hero known for not letting a single blade touch his fur. His luck comes to an end when a bell comically falls on him and ends his eighth life. This movie is a masterpiece for all ages with the different types of humor and themes brought up by the script. The movie focuses on the inevitablilty of death in life while being appropriate for younger audiences. Each character fits what role they are given to Puss in Boots flowing together.
                <br>
                <br>
                Death as the main antagonist is done nicely as he is introduced early on to scare Puss in Boots to be cautious with his life. Throughout the movie, he is creeping closer and closer while not interacting with Puss in Boots for most of his adventure. While Jack Horner and Goldi and Bears are also antagonists, their motives are predictable and their appearances are not as satisfying unlike Death.
                <br>
                <br>
                I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies and may need a break from more mature films or tv shows. It does not feel like a kid's movie you can not enjoy as an adult.
