                <p>This is the story of an American Hero that everyone needs and loves. Putting Snake Eater into words without nerding out on all the scenes is almost impossible with how amazing it is. If you like James Bond, Snake Eater is the Japanese equivalent, if not better, of those movies. While some scenes where stock war footage is used can drag on to explain the plot and time period the characters and their actions make up for two-fold while they are on screen. 
                <br>
                <br>
                With how serious the situation Naked Snake is in, they find a way to put in light-hearted comedy when you least expect it to keep the viewer interested. The Boss is a recurring character that comes in and out of the plot keeps you guessing what her motives are. She is not the only character to do this, but her signifigance to Naked Snake gives more emphasis on how shocking her defection to Russia is.
                <br>
                <br>
                I recommend Snake Eater to everyone. End Point. Even those who don't play video games can watch this on Youtube in parts and still see this masterpiece that is <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>. If watching this is still interesting to you, at least listen to Snake Eater the song link on the <a href="index.html"></a>.

                    <h3><em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em> Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>During the cutscenes before and during Colonel Volgin's fight, you can hold R1 at certain points to see The Sorrow holding a countdown timer for the C3 which is counting in real time and not a certain clock the game developers put in.</li>
                        <li>Defeating each boss with Non-Lethal means gives you the ability to pick up their special camo after their defeat.</li>
                        <li>Revolver Ocelot's Revolver tricks were recorded with motion capture. Therefore his stuntman, Tornado Yoshida, had to perform such crazy tricks like the triple revolver Russian Roulette juggle.</li>
